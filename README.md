First of all, I am an open source lover. Apache Member. Creator of several Apache Top-Level projects. Contribute for different open source projects in these years. And want to continue my contributions. ^_^

Right now, I am Tetrate.io Founding Engineer. Running following Open Source projects

1. Zipkin. As contributor, for design and code review.
1. (ex)Member of Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) OpenTracing Specification Council, for representing SkyWalking project. {The project is not active anymore.}

My work revolves around distributed systems, distributed tracer, APM, and runtime code generation/manipulation tech. My primary goal is to build an apm/tracer tool, with _High Efficient_, _Professional_, _for distributed-cluster or cloud_, and also **easy** to use. In particular, interested in how to build and diagnose large scale systems.

Due to the contributions across multiple open source community, be rewarded as Microsoft MVP, Alibaba Cloud MVP, Tencent Cloud TVP.
